# M3 Version control and collaboration

Weeks 4–6. Reviewed at Gate 1.

## Purpose

Test code is code. It lives in git, changes through pull requests, and is reviewed by others. M3 gives each person the everyday git and review habits that every later module depends on.

## Outcomes

- **LO3:** change test code through git and pull requests, and give and respond to review.

## Depth by track

| Module | B3 | B4-QA | B4-TE | B5-QA | B6-QA | B6-TE | B7-TE | B7-TM |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M3 Version control and collaboration | S | S | S | I | I | I | L | I |

## Activities

1. Clone the practice repository, make a branch, and commit a kata from M2.
2. Open a pull request with a clear description. Address the mentor's comments.
3. Review someone else's pull request. Be specific and kind. Ask questions rather than give orders.
4. Revert a bad commit. Resolve a simple merge conflict the mentor sets up.
5. Clone a testingexamples demo repository and use `git log` to read how its tests came to look the way they do.

### Good commit messages

- A short summary line, in the present tense: "Add NHS number check digit kata".
- A blank line, then why the change was made, if it is not obvious.

### Good review comments

- Say what you see and why it matters: "This test passes even when the function returns nothing, because it has no assertion."
- Ask, do not order: "Could this name say what it checks?"
- Say what is good, too.

## Evidence

**E3:** reviewed pull requests to a practice repository, with comments addressed.

| Track | Own pull requests | Reviews given |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B3, B4-QA, B4-TE | 2 | 1 |
| B5-QA, B6-QA, B6-TE, B7-TM | 3 | 1 |
| B7-TE | 3 | 3 |

## Assessment

Gate 1 (week 6) reviews E3 with E1 and E2. The Gate 1 Part D practical is "fix a failing unit test and open a pull request".
