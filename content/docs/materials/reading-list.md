# Reading list

Every resource named in the spec's core modules, with links. Track module resources (R1, R2, L1 to L5) are in `materials/tracks/`.

testingexamples.github.io articles use the English canonical address `/locales/en-001/<slug>/`. The site is also available in Welsh, Chinese, Arabic, Korean, French, and other English variants. Choose a locale from the site's picker.

Practice on the fixture site, local services, and your own test environments. Read, but do not repeatedly run, worked examples that target live third-party sites (Google Search, Google Maps, NHS Wales).

## Other languages and tools (after Gate 2)

Principle 9 says one language and one tool first. After Gate 2, people who want to compare can read the sibling skills and demos for Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, and Rust, for both Playwright and Selenium, at <https://github.com/testingexamples>.
