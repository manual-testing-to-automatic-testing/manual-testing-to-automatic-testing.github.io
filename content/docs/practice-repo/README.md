# Practice repository

The practice repository for the training programme from manual testing to automatic testing. Every participant works here from module M2 to M9, then applies the same habits to their own team's product in the capstone (M10).

The programme specification is [../spec/index.md](../spec/index.md). This repository is the practice environment it describes.

## Set up (module M0)

Requires Node.js 24 (see `.nvmrc`), git, and Visual Studio Code with the Playwright extension. For module M6 you also need Docker.

```sh
npm ci                                # install pinned dependencies
npx playwright install chromium       # install the test browser
npm run test:katas                    # check everything works
```

## Writing a new suite

1. Copy [`spec/index.md`](spec/index.md) into `spec/<suite-name>/index.md` and fill it in **before** writing code. [`spec/example/index.md`](spec/example/index.md) shows a filled-in spec.
2. Write the tests. Every test must make real assertions.
3. Show each test fails when the behaviour is wrong: change an expected value, run it, see it fail, then change it back.
4. Check the spec and the code agree. If they disagree, that is a defect.
5. Open a pull request using the template.

## The FHIR sandbox

The API tests need the local FHIR server in [`fhir-sandbox/`](fhir-sandbox/):

```sh
cd fhir-sandbox
docker compose up -d
scripts/load.sh
cd ..
npm run test:api
```

The sandbox is part of this repository, so the CI `api` job loads the same data. When you set up a cohort's practice repository, copy this whole folder.

## CI

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every pull request:

- **secrets-scan:** gitleaks, with the extra NHS number rule in `.gitleaks.toml`. Repositories owned by a GitHub organisation need a free `GITLEAKS_LICENSE` secret.
- **static:** typecheck, lint, format check.
- **katas:** unit tests.
- **ui:** browser tests, headless, with retries; the report and traces are uploaded as artifacts.
- **api:** API tests against a HAPI FHIR service container loaded with the synthetic data; the report is uploaded as an artifact.

Turn on branch protection for `main` and require these checks, so a failing test blocks the merge.

## Rules

- Synthetic data only. NHS numbers from the 999 test range only.
- No secrets in source control.
- No `test.only`, and no fixed sleeps.
- Read, don't hammer, third-party sites: the browser tests use the testingexamples fixture site, which exists for this purpose.
